## Overview of the project

### Project: TEMPERATURE CONVERTER

### OBJECTIVE:-
The objective of this C code is to create a Temperature Converter that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program provides a menu for users to choose the type of conversion, takes the input temperature, and outputs the converted temperature in another scale based on the user's choice.

## KEY FEATURES:-

**Simple Menu and User Interaction:**
The program presents a straightforward menu for the user to select the type of temperature conversion. It then prompts the user to input the temperature they want to convert.

**Conversion Functions:**
The program uses different functions to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Each function applies the appropriate formula to perform the conversion.

**Output Results:**
After performing the conversion based on the user's choice, the program displays the converted temperature to the user. This ensures the user gets the desired information quickly and accurately.

## Technologies used:-
**1. C Programming Language:**
Core Technology: The entire program is written in C, a high-level procedural programming language known for its efficiency and control over system resources.

**2. Standard Input and Output (stdio.h):**
Header File: The program includes the standard input/output library, which provides functions like printf and scanf for reading from and writing to the console.

**3. Functions:**
Function Prototypes and Definitions: The program uses function prototypes to declare the conversion functions at the beginning and defines these functions later in the code. This modular approach helps keep the code organized and makes it reusable.
